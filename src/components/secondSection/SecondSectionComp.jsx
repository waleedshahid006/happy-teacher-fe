              Hi, I'm Lynn Hardin!
            </Typography>  <br />
            <Typography className={`${classes.body} poppins-regular`}>
              I'm a leadership and life coach for educators. I am the <br />
              founder of "Happy Teacher Happy Life," and my mission is <br />
              to help you find health and happiness. Let's get back to <br />
              the things that make you happy: the success of your <br />
              students, a supportive community, meaningful <br />
              relationships, and wellness. <br /> <br />
              Iâ€™m a "tell it like it is" Texan with a warm heart for teachers <br />
              and our kids. I have a weakness for school supply stores, <br />
              yummy art supplies, and the poems of Sarah Blondin. <br />
              Lovely to meet you!
